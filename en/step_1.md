## Introduction

In this project, you will create a personalised rainbow coloured greeting on your Raspberry Pi Sense HAT. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**SenseHAT**</span> is an add-on board designed by Raspberry Pi Limited as an environmental sensor and display. There are currently two Raspberry Pi SenseHATs, within the [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/){:target="_blank"} Flight Units, on the International Space Station. Young people all over the world can run their code in space as part of the AstroPi programme!

You will:
+ Scroll a message across an **LED matrix**
+ Change the colour of the **LEDs** to produce a rainbow effect
+ Adjust the **speed** of how the message is displayed

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
An <span style="color: #0faeb0">**LED matrix**</span> is grid of LEDs that can be controlled individually or as a group to create different lighting effects. The LED matrix on the SenseHAT has 64 LEDs displayed in an 8 x 8 grid. The LEDs can be programmed to produce a wide range of colours.
</p>

You will need:
+ A web browser for the SenseHAT emulator

[[[rpi-sensehat-emulator]]]

Optional:
+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ A SenseHAT

[[[rpi-sensehat-attach]]]
