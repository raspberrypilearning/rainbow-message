The SenseHAT uses **RGB colour values** to produce the colours on the LED matrix. The values range from **0 - 255**. **0** means that it won't use any of that colour and **255** means that it will use the strongest version of that colour. 

The values are stated in the order: Red, Green, Blue.

Red can be created by using the following code snippet. 

`red = (255, 0, 0)`

The red value is set to **255** and the green and blue values are set to **0**, creating the colour red. 

Which code snippet can be used to create the colour blue?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `blue = (0, 255, 0)`


  --- feedback ---

Try again. This will create the colour green because the green value is set to **255** and the red and blue values are set to **0**.

- (x) `blue = (0, 0, 255)`


  --- feedback ---

Correct! The blue value has been set to **255** and the red and green values have been set to **0**. This means that a blue colour will be produced.
