legend: Question 1 of 3

A young creator has managed to make their message scroll across the LED matrix, but the writing is appearing upside-down! Which command should they use to correct this?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `sense.set_rotation(0)`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite! By setting the `rotation` to zero, the message will show exactly the same way. This is because the angle of display has not changed from the default value of `0`. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) `sense.set_rotation(180)`

  --- feedback ---

Correct! Setting the `rotation` to `180` will display the writing upside-down compared to the default setting. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `sense.set_rotation(90)`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite! By setting the `rotation` to `90`, the message will show sideways from bottom to top. This is because the angle of display has been rotated a quarter turn from the default value of `0`. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `sense.set_rotation(270)`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite! By setting the `rotation` to `270`, the message will show sideways from top to bottom. This is because the angle of display has been rotated three-quarters of a turn from the default value of `0`.
