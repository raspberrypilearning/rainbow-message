legend: Question 1 of 3

A young creator has set their `scroll_speed` to `0.5` but they think that this is too slow. Which value should they use to make the message scroll faster?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `scroll_speed = 1`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite! By setting the `scroll_speed` to one, the message will scroll at a slower speed. This is because it moves 1 second at a time. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) `scroll_speed = 0.1`

  --- feedback ---

Correct! `0.1` is a lower number than `0.5` so the scroll speed will be much faster with this number. The text will move along every 0.1 seconds.
